## Bayesian Model Averaging

Contains compilation of files and scripts related to Bayesian Model Averaging, mostly as it pertains to my M.A. thesis 

Most files here are incomplete, and represent scripts I have written to try/practice various models and algorithms related to BMA and logistic regression. They will be updated eventually once finalized.

ML_LinReg files are a modified version of base script originally posted by Dr. Florian Hartig

Files with leading 'Yuan_' are scripts that correspond to a project/article published by:
 * Yuan, S., Kroon, B., & Kramer, A. (2021). Building prediction models with grouped data: A case study on the prediction of turnover intention. Human Resource Management Journal.

 * turnover_data contains the full (employee-level and organization-level) dataset and was used for the thesis
 * turnover_L1_only contains only the employee-level predictors and was used for previous analyses
