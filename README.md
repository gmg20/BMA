## Bayesian Model Averaging

Contains compilation of files and scripts related to Bayesian Model Averaging, mostly as it pertains to my M.A. thesis.
 * Compared predictive performance of Random Forest Regression/Classifiers, OLS/Logistic regression, and Bayesian Model Averaging in predicting employee turnover intentions and flight risk status (regression and classification contexts)
 * Evaluated out-of-sample generalizability using train/test split 

ML_LinReg files are a modified version of base script originally posted by Dr. Florian Hartig
 * https://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2010/09/17/metropolis-hastings-mcmc-in-r/

Files with leading 'Yuan_' are scripts that correspond to a project/article published by:
 * Yuan, S., Kroon, B., & Kramer, A. (2021). Building prediction models with grouped data: A case study on the prediction of turnover intention. Human Resource Management Journal.

 * turnover_data.csv contains both the employee-level and org-level predictors (used for this project)
